# PermMemento
Keep your chosen memento effects active permanently.

## Description
PermMemento automates your mementos so you don't have to manually refresh them. It distinguishes between **Mobile** mementos (auras that fire instantly) and **Stationary** mementos (animations that wait for idle state).

## Key Features
* **Permanent Mementos:** Makes memento effects like Finvir's Trinket or Almalexia’s Lantern or Wild Hunt Transform remain permanent, waits until you are out of combat/idle to avoid interrupting gameplay.
* **Group Sync:** Share your active memento with your party using chat slash commands.
* **Status UI:** A simple, draggable UI label shows current memento and its cooldowns and player state.

## Usage (PC & Console)

> [!TIP]
> **AUTO-LOOP:** Simply activate any supported memento via your in-game **Collectibles > Mementos** menu. The addon will detect it and begin the loop automatically no slash commands required!
